**Quantum Court** is a decentralized judicial system prototype designed to demonstrate **Blind Justice as a Service**. It removes human bias from adjudication by relying on a tripartite system of Immutable Law (Smart Contracts), Bridge Logic (Python Oracle), and Absolute Truth (Quantum Physics).

## 🏛️ The Architect's Vision
**By Damian Griggs | Adaptive Systems Architect**

I utilize the **Centaur Model** for development—a symbiotic workflow where I act as the Systems Architect providing the logic, vision, and high-level design, while Artificial Intelligence serves as the "Bricklayer," handling syntax and implementation details. This project is a demonstration that disability is a catalyst for adaptive innovation, not a barrier.

The goal of Quantum Court is to engineer a governance system where corruption is mathematically impossible.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The system operates on three distinct layers of reality:

### 1. The Law (Solidity Smart Contract)
* **Location:** Avalanche Fuji Testnet.
* **Role:** Holds the immutable state of the trial (`Innocent`, `Guilty`, `Deadlock`).
* **Security:** Once deployed, the rules cannot be changed by politicians or developers.

### 2. The Bridge (Python Oracle)
* **Role:** Listens for `QuantumOracleSummoned` events emitted by the contract.
* **Function:** Acts as the secure courier between the blockchain and the physical world.

### 3. The Truth (Quantum Physics)
* **Source:** ANU Quantum Optics Lab API.
* **Role:** Harvests live vacuum fluctuations (subatomic noise) to generate truly random, non-deterministic verdicts.

## 🔴 Live Deployment

The "Constitution" of this court is currently live and verifiable on the public ledger.

## 🛡️ Protocol Omega: The Fail-Safe

To ensure Sovereign Grade reliability, the Oracle does not rely solely on external APIs.

1.  **Primary Feed:** Live Quantum Vacuum data from ANU (Australia).
2.  **Fail-Safe (Protocol Omega):** If the external feed is severed (offline/attack), the Oracle instantly switches to a local **"Cold Storage"** entropy reserve (`secrets/quantum_reserve.txt`).
3.  **Future Vision:** The production roadmap replaces the file reserve with **Hardware Snapshots**, harvesting local thermal and voltage noise for true air-gapped randomness.
